# Command Line Project 
## 📘 Project Overview
This project implements a **Command Line Interpreter (CLI)** in **Java**, designed to simulate the functionality of a basic operating system terminal.  
The CLI accepts user input, parses it into commands and arguments, and executes actions directly on the file system.

The program continues running until the user types `exit`.

## ⚙️ Main Components
### 🧩 `Parser` Class
- Reads and parses user input.
- Separates the **command name** and **arguments**.
- Validates input format.

### ⚡ `Terminal` Class
- Executes all supported commands.
- Handles file and directory operations.
- Displays output and error messages.
